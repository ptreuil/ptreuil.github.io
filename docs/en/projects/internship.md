## Exploitation and apprehension of the correspondence of Henri Poincaré

*(Printemps 2024 - Supervisé par [Emmanuel Nauer](https://members.loria.fr/ENauer/) - LORIA, Université de Lorraine)*

The Henri Poincaré (1854-1912) correspondance corpus contains more than 2000 letters written or received by the mathematcian. This letters, analysed inside de Henri Poincaré Archives have been numerised, transcribed and semantically annotated. Historians’ worked on this letters led to their publication into thematic volumes (youth letters, letters to the mathematicians, letters to the geodesians ...)

This corpus is currently available on a [site web](https://henripoincare.fr/) and a SPARQL endpoint allow to query directly the knowledgebase. The difficulties to use SPARQL met by non-computer scientist researchers and the need to know the vocabulary used for the semantic annotation led to the implementation of a new conversational query system. This tool gives a hierarchical access to the letters, which is automatically computed using formal concept analysis on the letters properties. The user can interact with this system to precise their need in an iterative way. At each iteration, the sytem will show some properties groupings. Once the user have selected some groups as interesting or not, the results will be recomputed. This allow to explore the corpus step by step and discover new links between the data of each letters.

This current internship should integrate new properties to use for the letters exploitation. For exemple, terms can be extracted from the text, simple or noun chunks. This new properties will be added to the knowledge graph in order to extend the conversational tool abilities to answer the need of the historians using the systems. They will be able to organise the terminologie used to best suit their research, to create new concepts and organise them into an ontology. This new concepts and their structure should be immediatly ready to be used by the sytsem to reorganise the documents.
